Ey There!
I used CHATGPT To generate the examples. Too much work for me...
Sadly it is almost the first time I use it, therefore the queries for chatgpt where not perfect neither good and the examples
are not good enough (from my point of view) As some values repeat themself.
Next time will be better... More variety!
I let it like this, since there are 3 levels and just this level is two exercises like this. :D
